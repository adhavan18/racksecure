# 📚 RackSecure – AI-Powered Theft Detection for Shared Spaces

RackSecure is an advanced AI-based theft detection system designed for monitoring publicly shared rack spaces in libraries, gyms, schools, hostels, and warehouses. Using state-of-the-art machine learning models like YOLOv8 and OpenCV, it detects unauthorized item removals and instantly notifies administrators via email alerts.
