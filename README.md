Your GitHub README is engaging and well-structured! Here are a few suggestions to improve clarity and professionalism:  

Suggestions:  
1. Reduce Icons – Some sections have too many icons, making the text a bit cluttered.  
2. Make It More Formal – Phrases like "Thieves think they’re slick… but our AI is slicker!" add a fun touch, but for a serious security project, a more professional tone might be better.  
3. Better Formatting for Key Sections – Using bullet points and bold text for emphasis can improve readability.  

Improved Version:
